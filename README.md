# Out of the box captcha solver

In this tutorial we are grabbing all symbols from CAPTCHA, checking order of symbols, detection accuracy and overlappings. We use all these components to write final working out of the box CAPTCHA solver. 

This is only the final code, if you would like to learn how to use this code to solve CAPTCHAS visit my website: [http://pylessons.com](http://pylessons.com/TensorFlow-CAPTCHA-final-detection/). Also there is detailed explanation how to train your own model.

If you downloaded these files, what you will need to do first is extract CAPTCHA_frozen_inference_graph.7z in local directory. I added this file to 7zip because it was too large to upload it to github, so I ziped them as 2 files. 

After this open CAPTCHA_object_detection.py file and check if you have all imported libraries to run this model.

After that, open main_.py file and you can try to solve my examples.

If you have questions, you can find solutions on my text version tutorials, but if you still have questions write your comment under my YouTube video tutorial.
